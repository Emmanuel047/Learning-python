#Exercise: Basic Withdrawal Simulator (without classes)
#Ask the user to input their wallet balance (float).

#Ask the user to input an amount they want to withdraw.

#Use a try-except block to:

#Catch invalid number inputs (ValueError).

#Check if withdrawal amount is more than balance. If so, print a friendly error message but donâ€™t use custom exceptions.

#If withdrawal is valid, print the new balance.

#Use finally to print a thank-you message.
