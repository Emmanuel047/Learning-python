i have an idea on the basic data types  but not yte used them effectively this refers to lists, dictionaries, sets 
i can write some functions a little practise is all that i currently need 
i am confident with python loops the for and the while
for error handling rn i feel am good at it also practice is needed.
data structures and algorithms is a topic i havent touched but know is really needed.
for modules i know how to import them but for that i am sure it needs projects but i havent used any ecxept the maths one only.
OOP is a topic i know but needs a little refreshing of the memory
i need projects to practice my python skills am hoping to lock in and be conversely fluent is 3 months 
you can create a roadmap to cover all these keeping in mind i want to dedicate 3+ hours of my day to python


Learning Python
Month 1: Strengthen Core Concepts & Basics
Week 1-2: Data Types & Functional Programming
Deep dive into lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples.

Practice data type operations: indexing, slicing, adding, removing elements.

Write functions that manipulate these collections.

Exercises on comprehensions (list, dict).

Mini-project: Contact list manager using dictionaries and lists.

Week 3-4: Control Flow & Error Handling
Master if, elif, else with nested conditions.

Practice loops with real tasks (e.g., iterating over collections, searching).

Build multiple nested loops for matrix-like data.

Advanced try-except, custom exceptions.

Mini-project: ATM transaction simulator (deposit, withdraw, balance inquiry) with full error handling.

Month 2: Data Structures, Algorithms & Modules
Week 5-6: Data Structures & Algorithms Fundamentals
Study common data structures (stack, queue, linked list concepts).

Learn simple algorithms (sorting: bubble, insertion; searching: linear, binary).

Code basic algorithm implementations.

Practice problems on algorithmic thinking.

Week 7-8: Modules & Standard Libraries
Deep dive into Python standard modules: math, random, datetime, os, json.

Start using external libraries (e.g., requests for web data).

Projects using APIs, data parsing, or file handling.

Mini-project: Weather report fetcher from a public API.

Month 3: Object-Oriented Programming & Projects
Week 9-10: OOP Fundamentals
Refresh classes, objects, attributes, methods.

Practice inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.

Create multiple interacting classes.

Exercises: Building a small bank account class system with transactions and history.

Week 11-12: Build and Polish Projects
Combine everything in full-fledged projects emphasizing practical skills.

Example projects:

Personal Budget Manager (OOP, file handling)

Simple Blogging Platform (data structures, classes)

Tic-Tac-Toe Game (loops, conditionals, OOP)

Focus on writing clean, modular, testable code.

Ongoing Practices:
Dedicate 1 hour daily to practice exercises/problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Exercism focused on data structures and algorithms.

Read Python documentation and articles to cultivate idiomatic Python usage.

Write daily journal-style notes or blog posts explaining concepts you learn.
